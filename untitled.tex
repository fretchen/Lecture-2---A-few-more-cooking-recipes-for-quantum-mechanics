In the \href{https://www.authorea.com/326007/wyOpqBcLPiiNhswBbwDHbA}{first lecture} we discussed briefly the basic principles of quantum mechanics like operators, state vectors and the Schrödinger equation. We will finish this discussion today and then introduce the most important consequences. We will continue to closely follow the discussion of the introductory chapter of Ref. \cite{2006}

\section{Statistical Mixtures and Density Operator}

If only the subsystem of a pure quantum state is accessible to measurements, or the state of the system is not known at the microscopic level (statistical ensemble!), the state of the system has to be described by a Hermitian density operator

\begin{align}
 \hat{\rho} = \sum_{n=1}^N p_n \ket{\phi_n}\bra{\phi_n}.
\end{align}
Here, $\bra{\phi_n}$ are the eigenstates of $\hat{\rho}$, and $p_n$ are the probabilities to find the system in the respective states $\ket{\phi_n}$.

Let us now have a brief look at the properties of the density operator:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The trace of the density operator is the sum of all probabilities $p_n$:
	%
	\begin{align}
	    \tr{\rhohat} = \sum p_n = 1.
	\end{align}
				%
	\item For a pure state $\ket{\psi}$, we get $p_n=1$ for only one value of $n$. For every other $n$, the probabilities vanish. We thus obtain a ``pure'' density operator $\rhohat_{\text{pure}}$ which has the properties of a projection operator:
				%
	\begin{align}
					\rhohat_{\text{pure}} = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi} \qquad \Longleftrightarrow \qquad \rhohat^2 = \rhohat.
				\end{align}
\end{itemize}
			%
With this knowledge we can now determine the result of a measurement of an observable $A$ belonging to an operator $\hat{A}$. For the pure state $\ket{\psi}$ we get:
%
\begin{align}
				\langle \hat{A}\rangle \bra{\psi} \hat{A} \ket{\psi}.
\end{align}
			%
For a mixed state we get:
			%
\begin{align}
	\tr{\rhohat \cdot \hat{A}} = \sum_n {p_n} \bra{\phi_n} \hat{A} \ket{\phi_n}.
\end{align}
The time evolution of the density operator can be expressed with the von Neumann equation:
\begin{align}
	i\hbar \partial_{t}\rhohat(t) = [\hat{H}(t),\rhohat(t)].
\end{align}
\textbf{Example.} 
If we consider a system $S = S_1 \otimes S_2$ comprised of two subsystems $S_1$, $S_2$, then the density operator $\hat{\rho}_i$ of  subsystem $i$ is
					%
					\begin{align}
						\rhohat_1=&\trarb{2}{\rhohat},\\
						\rhohat_2=&\trarb{1}{\rhohat},
					\end{align}
					%
					where $\hat{\rho}=\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ and $\trarb{j}{\rhohat}$ is the trace over the Hilbert space of subsystem $j$ (cf. first tutorial).
