In the first lecture \cite{Jendrzejewski} we discussed briefly the basic principles of quantum mechanics like operators, state vectors and the Schr√∂dinger equation. We will finish this discussion today and then introduce the most important consequences. We will continue to closely follow the discussion of the introductory chapter of Ref. \cite{2006}
